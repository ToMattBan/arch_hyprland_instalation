# Some notes first:
# It's recommended to use tmux for ease of reading while using the scripts, cheat sheet here https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/
# Don't forget to uncomment multilib after adding the repos with script 4
# In script 7 you might need to cd or change the path of ./user-paths to match this folder location
# In script 9 Same as above, ^ or ^ of ./package_list.txt to match this folder location
# There's also a issue with 8, not working when run from script, but typing each command mannualy works
